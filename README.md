# Java Connection to MySQL

This is a little project in Apache NetBeans with Java and the driver_mysql. This is part of the clase of Advanced Programming I of the Technology University of Honduras. With the master **Hector Conrado Lanza A**.

First is important to undestand than you have to install MySQL in your computer to test the system here created. You can download the installer [right here.](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/) Download the version of your operating system and install it.
> I recomend to use a software to check the structure of the DB in a graphic environment. You can download a software like [My SQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/). The community version is obsolutly for free.

Now, let start to create a system to **connect Java to MySQL**.

## 1. Make sure you have MySQL running on your computer.
MySQL is a service who has to be running on your local computer to test the system. You can check if this service is running just open a terminarl or a console or CMD on Windows and white:

    mysql

Maybe you have to input the **user** and the **password** setted in the installetion. If this works so your computer has the service running. 
> If you got another response,[ learn how to start the service in your operating system](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/starting-and-stopping-mysql-server).

If everything was ok, we can continue, to exit of the MySQL environment just write:

    exit()

## 2. Create a Java Project on Apache NetBeans
